This is a repository to help researchers use statistical extracts produced as part of two papers coauthored by Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler:

- "Imperfect competition, compensating differentials, and rent sharing in the US labor market" by Thibaut Lamadon, Magne Mogstad, and Bradley Setzler. American Economic Review 112.1 (2022): 169-212.

- "How Much Should we Trust Estimates of Firm Effects and Worker Sorting?" by St√©phane Bonhomme, Kerstin Holzheu, Thibaut Lamadon, Elena Manresa, Magne Mogstad, and Bradley Setzler. Working Paper w27368. National Bureau of Economic Research (2021).

## Differences over Time for Stayers in the US Tax Data

Here, we provide the estimates of the regional pass-through from firm productivity shocks to the earnings of workers.  In particular, we provide the region-specific changes in log earnings and log value added relative to event time zero at which a log value added shock occurs using the   approach described under the heading ``Difference-in-Difference Illustration of Internal Instruments" in subsection III.A of [LMS](https://www.bradleysetzler.com/files/LMS-supplement.pdf). The provided variables are:

- `EventTime`: This is the number of years since the treated group received a positive log value added shock and the control group did not.
- `LogVADiff_Unconditional` and `LogWageDiff_Unconditional`: These variables are the mean difference in firm-specific log value added and log earnings among stayers, respectively, between the treated group and control group at a particular event time. 
- `LogVADiff_MarketLevel` and `LogWageDiff_MarketLevel`: These variables are the mean difference in market-level averages of log value added and log earnings among stayers, respectively, between the treated group and control group at a particular event time. 
- `LogVADiff_FirmLevel` and `LogWageDiff_FirmLevel`:  These variables are similar to `LogVADiff_Unconditional` and `LogWageDiff_Unconditional`, respectively, but controlling for market-year fixed effects.

The statistical extract containing these estimates is available for download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setzler/LMS-Statistical-Extracts/main/StatisticalExtracts/LMS-Stayer-Differences.csv). The first 3 rows of the statistical extract are as follows:

## Region-Sector Pass-through for Stayers in the US Tax Data

Here, we provide the region-specific instrumental variables estimation of the pass-through from log value added to  log earnings using the approach described under the heading ``Formal Identification Using Internal Instruments" in subsection III.A of [LMS](https://www.bradleysetzler.com/files/LMS-supplement.pdf).  Denoting log earnings by $w$ and log value added by $y$, the empirical equation is,

$$ \mathbb{E}[ \Delta y_t (w_{t+e} - w_{t-e'} - \gamma_r(y_{t+e} - y_{t-e'}))  ] = 0 $$
which is estimated only among workers who are stayers and which is estimated separately for each broad market $r$. A similar equation is estimated using market-level means across all broad markets, in which case the parameter estimate is denoted $\Upsilon$.The preferred estimates of $\gamma_r$ are based on firm-level deviations from market-level means.  The estimated $(\gamma_r,\Upsilon)$ parameters can then be transformed into the preference parameters $(\rho_r,\beta)$.

The statistical extract contains the following estimates:

- `BroadMarket`: This variable indicates the broad market, defined as a region and a sector of the economy.
- `UnconditionalPassthrough`: This variable indicates the IV estimate of $\gamma_r$ that does not control for market-year fixed effects.
- `NetPassthrough`: This variable indicates the preferred IV estimate of $\gamma_r$ that  controls for market-year fixed effects.
- `MarketPassthrough`: This variable indicates the IV estimate of $\Upsilon$ using only market-level aggregate data; this estimate does not vary across broad markets.
- `Parameter_rho`: This is the estimate of the within-market preference parameter $\rho_r$, which varies across broad markets.
- `Parameter_beta`: This is the estimate of the between-market preference parameter $\beta$; this estimate does not vary across broad markets.

Estimating this equation requires population employer-employee data on earnings and firm value added. We provide estimates of the various terms in this equation. The statistical extract containing these estimates is available for download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setzler/LMS-Statistical-Extracts/main/StatisticalExtracts/LMS-Regional-Passthrough.csv). The first 3 rows of the statistical extract are as follows:

``` {r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

dd = setDT(read.csv(file="StatisticalExtracts/LMS-Regional-Passthrough.csv"))

## Earnings Inequality and Firm-Worker Clusters in the US Tax Data

Here, we provide the estimates of the equilibrium earnings expression presented in equation (14) of [LMS](https://www.bradleysetzler.com/files/LMS-supplement.pdf) using the empirical specification and estimation approach described in subsection IV.A of LMS. The empirical equation is,

$$w^a_{k}(x) = \psi_k + x\theta_k $$

where $k$ denotes a cluster of firms, $x$ denotes the measure of worker skill, $w^a$ is the predicted log wage after residualization and adjustment for productivity shocks, $\psi$ is the cluster-specific wage premium, and $\theta$ is the cluster-specific skill complementarity.

Estimating this equation requires population employer-employee data on earnings and firm value added. We provide estimates of the various terms in this equation, evaluated at quantiles $q$ in the $x$ distribution. In particular, the variables are:

- `FirmCluster_k`: This variable indicates the cluster $k$ of firms.
- `Size_FirmCluster_k`: This variable indicates the number of workers employed by cluster $k$.
- `FirmPremium_psik`: This variable indicates the firm premium $\psi_k$ for cluster $k$.
- `SkillComplementarity_thetak`: This variable indicates the skill complementarity $\theta_k$ for cluster $k$.
- `WorkerDecile_q`: This variable indicates quantile $q$ in the distribution of $x$.
- `WorkerSkill_xq`: This variable indicates the value of worker skill $x$ at quantile $q$.
- `ExpectedLogWage_wkq`: This variable indicates the expected log wage $w^a$ for cluster $k$ and worker skill quantile $q$, which is residualized on observables and adjusted for productivity shocks.

The estimates are available for download [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setzler/LMS-Statistical-Extracts/main/StatisticalExtracts/LMS-Firm-Worker-Matches.csv).

``` {r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
dd = setDT(read.csv(file="StatisticalExtracts/LMS-Firm-Worker-Matches.csv"))
knitr::kable(dd[1:3])
```

In case the user prefers not to use the LMS adjustment for productivity shocks, the unadjusted version of these estimates are available for download  [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/setzler/LMS-Statistical-Extracts/main/StatisticalExtracts/LMS-Firm-Worker-Matches_unadjusted.csv).
